# Crowd-Density-Detection-System
This project aims to analyze real-time crowd density in public spaces using computer vision and deep learning techniques. By processing video feeds (e.g., from CCTV cameras), the system detects the number of people in a given area and estimates how crowded it is. Based on the detected density, the system can provide smart recommendations.
